==================================
🧠 VERSION 2 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET
==================================

This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:

1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
   What kind of HTTP request do we need to send, and to what API endpoint?
   If we are sending a POST request, what do we need to send in the request body, and what is the data type?
   What would we get back in the response, and what is the data t ype?

2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data?
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page?

3. WHERE does this happen in the code?
   What component, page or function?

4. HOW do we accomplish this?
   What steps do we need to take?
   Do we need to...
   - make any GET or POST requests to an API endpoint?
   - render anything in JSX?
   - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions?
   - use any useState or useEffect hooks?
     Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet — just outline the actions in plain language.

✨ YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data.

==================================
📊 FORM DATA
==================================

========================
🔶 STORING FORM DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
API ENDPOINT: /add-one-user

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): Object (JSON)
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): ------
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "country_name": "Germany",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "bio": "A little about Alice"
}

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: String
RESPONSE: Success! User has been added.

❓ WHEN: When the user clicks Submit on the SavedCountries form.

❓ WHERE: In SavedCountries.jsx, inside the handleSubmit function.

❓ HOW:
Step 1: Make the form controlled by using useState.
Step 2: When the form submits build the object the API expects. eg.name,country_name etc
Step 3: Send a fetch() POST request with the method POST.
Add more steps as needed!

========================
🔶 RETRIEVING FORM DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): GET
API ENDPOINT: /get-newest-user

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): N/A
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): N/A

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: An array with one object
RESPONSE: ------
[
  {
    "user_id": 42,
    "name": "John Smith",
    "country_name": "Canada",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "bio": "Another bio"
  }
]

❓ WHEN: When the SavedCountries page loads

❓ WHERE: In the SavedCountries.jsx, in a function like getNewestUserData()
that is being called inside useEffect.

❓ HOW:
Step 1: Someone needs to fill out the form first and submit.
Step 2: Make an async function called getNewestUserData that uses fetch() to send a GET request to the endpoint /get-newest-user. 
Then the function saves the data to a state variable called newestUserData.
Step 3: We will use useEffect to call getNewestUserData() on page load.
Step 4: Render the newest users name to the screen in JSX.

===================================
📊 SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
===================================

========================
🔶 STORING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
API ENDPOINT: /save-one-country

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): Object (JSON)
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): ------
{
  "country_name": "Brazil"
}


RESPONSE DATA TYPE: String
RESPONSE: Success! The country is saved.

❓ WHEN: When the user clicks the Save button on the CountryDetail page.

❓ WHERE: In CountryDetail.jsx, inside the handleSaveCountry() function.

❓ HOW:
Step 1: Make a Save button click handler.
Step 2: Send POST request with the country_name ~ name.common.
Step 3: After success you can show a message eg. Saved! or refresh saved list later on.
Add more steps as needed!

========================
🔶 RETRIEVING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): GET
API ENDPOINT: /get-all-saved-countries

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): ------
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): ------

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: Array of objects
RESPONSE: ------
[
  {
    "country_name": "Japan"
  },
  {
    "country_name": "Germany"
  }
]


❓ WHEN: When the SavedCountries page loads and also after saving a country.

❓ WHERE: In SavedCountries.jsx, in a function like getSavedCountries(); and it has to be called in useEffect.

❓ HOW:
Step 1: Create state ~ const [savedCountries, setSavedCountries] = useState([]).
Step 2: Make getSavedCountries() fetch the GET endpoint.
Step 3: Save response array into state.
Step 4: Render country cards above the form.
Add more steps as needed!

=================================
📊 COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
=================================

========================
🔶 STORING & RETRIEVING COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
========================
NOTE: We combine storing & retrieving country counts data into one section because they always happen together. Each time we look up a country’s view count, we also need to increase it and save the new total.

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
API ENDPOINT: /update-one-country-count

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): Object
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): ------
{
  "country_name": "France"
}


RESPONSE DATA TYPE: Object
RESPONSE: ------
{
  "count": 3
}


❓ WHEN: Every time the CountryDetail page loads for a country, in other words
each time a user views a country.

❓ WHERE: In the CountryDetail.jsx, iside useEffect() which runs when the countryCode 
changes or the page loads.

❓ HOW:
Step 1: When the CountryDetail page loads and the country is found, then get the country name (name.common).
Step 2: Send POST request to /update-one-country-count with { country_name: name.common }.
Step 3: Save the returned count in state {eg. viewCount}.
Step 4: Render the viewcCount in JSX {eg. # of views is 3}
